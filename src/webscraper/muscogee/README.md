#Prerequisites to run

Have beautiful soup and selenium installed.  On Windows with Python 3.6 installed and added to PATH, install them with these commands:
'''
pip install selenium
pip install beautifulsoup4

You also need to download the Chromedriver and copy its system path.
To download chromedriver.exe go to this address: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
I am using v2.33.
Extract the zipped file anywhere you want to keep it and copy the path (shift+right-click >> "Copy as Path"). Add the path to the script inside the "chrome_path" variable.  
'''
chrome_path = r""
'''

#Running the program
